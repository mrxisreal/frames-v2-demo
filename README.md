# Mini App

A demo [mini app](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz) to demonstrate the functionality available for mini app developers in [Base App](https://base.app).

## Getting Started

This is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) + TypeScript + React app.

To install dependencies:

```bash
$ bun install
```

To run the app:

```bash
$ bun dev
```

> Note: This project uses Bun by default but you can use npm, yarn, or pnpm if you prefer.

To test your mini app in Farcaster's playground or in Base App, you'll want to use a tunneling tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
